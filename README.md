# Haxe language server

This will become a language server implementing [VS Code language server protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-protocol) for [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) language.

Currently here are just some experiments.

The goal of this project is to encapsulate haxe's completion API with all its quirks behind a solid and easy-to-use
protocol that can be used by any editor/IDE.
